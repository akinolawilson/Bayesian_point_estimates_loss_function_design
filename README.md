# Bayesian_point_estimates_loss_function_design
The notebook exemplifies using Bayesian inference to analyse the risk associated to loss functions, used to train machine learning algorithms. By assuming the non-trainable parameters of a model are themselves random variables (with prior and posterior distributions), we may quantify the expected loss (a.k.a risk) of choosing our parameter to estimate the true parameter.
